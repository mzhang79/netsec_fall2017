There are three .py files in the lab_1e folder.

I define the higherProtocol1 and higherProtocol2 in the PassthroughProtocol.py. At the same time, it is imported in both the lab_1e_Client.py and the lab_1e_Server.py

For executing the lab_1e project, you can run the lab_1e_Server.py first and then run the lab_1e_Client.py.


All of the above is the first version of the README.md. I find some problem in it and I want to change it to this:


README_2.0:
